This situation is a deadlock situation.

The reason is that they are all went to sleep and looking at each other(holding the lock of other angel) and waiting for the 
other angel(thread) to wake them up(signal them), but this will never happen as they are all went to sleep.

In contrast, if it is a livelock situation, all angels should be awake and constantly change state between each other and none
stop. But this is not the case, as they are all sleeping and non-state changing is happening. So this is NOT a livelock
It is a deadlock.
